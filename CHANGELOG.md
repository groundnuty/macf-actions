## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- Initial release. Extracts the routing Action from `groundnuty/macf` into a reusable workflow.
- `agent-router.yml` reusable workflow with three jobs:
  - `route-by-label` — SSH + tmux delivery when issue is labeled with an agent name
  - `route-by-mention` — SSH + tmux delivery when agent is `@mentioned`
  - `cleanup-labels` — strips status labels on issue close
- Behavior matches the current per-repo Action exactly — same SSH+tmux delivery, same config file format, same secrets.
- Callable via `uses: groundnuty/macf-actions/.github/workflows/agent-router.yml@v1` with `secrets: inherit`.
- Reads `.github/agent-config.json` from the caller's checkout.
