# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-17

### Added

- `route-by-ci-completion` job in `agent-router.yml` (#6). Notifies the authoring agent's tmux session when CI finishes on an agent-authored PR, eliminating the wait-for-human-ping polling pattern. Filters out human/external authors, draft PRs, stale CI after force-push, and non-actionable conclusions (`neutral`/`cancelled`/`skipped`).
- On success: routes a prompt like `PR #N: CI SUCCESS. URL. Next: merge if you're the author.`
- On failure: names the first failing check (from `check_runs` enumeration) for faster triage.
- Shell-quoting hardened: strips single quotes from generated prompts (user-controlled PR titles) to prevent remote-parse breakage.

### Non-breaking caller change

Consumers subscribing to the reusable workflow need to add `check_suite: { types: [completed] }` to their caller workflow's `on:` list to receive CI-completion routing. Without this, existing v1.0 behavior (label + mention routing) continues unchanged — the new job simply never fires.

### Permissions

The reusable workflow now requests `checks: read` to enumerate `check_runs` in a completed suite. Consumers inheriting permissions via `secrets: inherit` get this automatically on the managed runner; no caller-side change needed.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- Initial release. Extracts the routing Action from `groundnuty/macf` into a reusable workflow.
- `agent-router.yml` reusable workflow with three jobs:
  - `route-by-label` — SSH + tmux delivery when issue is labeled with an agent name
  - `route-by-mention` — SSH + tmux delivery when agent is `@mentioned`
  - `cleanup-labels` — strips status labels on issue close
- Behavior matches the current per-repo Action exactly — same SSH+tmux delivery, same config file format, same secrets.
- Callable via `uses: groundnuty/macf-actions/.github/workflows/agent-router.yml@v1` with `secrets: inherit`.
- Reads `.github/agent-config.json` from the caller's checkout.

### Tags

- `v1.0.0` — immutable
- `v1.0` — floats to latest `v1.0.x`
- `v1` — floats to latest `v1.x.x`
